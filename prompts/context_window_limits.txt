Title: Andean Condor
The Andean Condor is one of the most famous endangered species in Peru. It lives in the mountains, where it can fly across valleys and cliffs, always looking for food. Its habitat is usually very high, and people are always impressed when they see its huge wings.
For me, the condor is special because it is part of Inca history, and many people still acknowledge it as a sacred animal. Sadly, the population of Condors has been assessed as very low in the past years. The main problems are hunting, poaching, and the lack of places where they can live.
Fortunately, there are some dedicated projects in Peru trying to protect the Condor, like releasing them back into the wild and educating people not to harm them. I think it is important to remember that this animal is not only part of the nature but also part of our culture.

Title: Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial
Even though I was absent during the class tour to the Anne Frank Human Rights Memorial, I have read about Anne Frank and her story. In my country, Peru, there are some memorials that honor human rights, especially those that remember us the victims of terrorism and political violence during the 80s and 90s. These places are meant to remind us of the importance of justice, peace, and respect for life.
I heard of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights before, but I have never studied it deeply.  Learning about Anne Frank’s story made me reflect more on its importance. The Declaration is not only a document, it represents more than that and the hope that these tragedies should never happen again. 
Anne Frank’s and Jona’s life have some things in common, for example they both lived under systems that controlled people’s choices and silent their voices. Their stories show how freedom was taken away from them.

Title: Yellow Submarine
Music is a way people can communicate or express their feelings. It can transport you to good or bad memories in your life. Either way, there is always a meaning behind every song or piece of music. 
Whenever someone asks me what my favorite music, song or band is, it’s hard to choose. I really like many kinds of music, and I think this is because I was exposed to different types of music during my whole life. The first kind of music I heard was Pop, I remember my sisters were coming back from their trip to the USA, and brought a lot of disks from Pink, Avril Lavigne, Akon, Shakira, and others. For some reason, I loved all of them and whenever I hear music from those artists, it always reminds me of my sisters. 
When I was at school, I started listening to Reggaeton, Salsa and Bachata, they are very popular in Latin culture. I still love them and enjoy listening to and dancing. I think these types of music are charged with lots of energy. I also like Reggae, Hip Hop and R&B, these remind me of my time during university and the friends I made. But if someone asks me for a specific song, probably I won’t be able to tell. I am very bad with songs or artist’s names, but once I hear a piece of the music, I can recognize it.
The song I chose at class was Yellow Submarine by The Beatles, it reminds me of my first experience traveling to a foreign country, living by myself and getting to know people from different nationality, it was a great experience to me that I won’t forget. And from what I’ve seen in class, every one of us has a song or piece of music that has a beautiful and unique meaning.

Title: The Beginning of the Beginning
When you choose a career, you often believe it will define your future. I felt the same way when I decided to study obstetrics because I wanted to help people and was sure that I found my purpose. But as time went on, I realized that this career was not the right fit for me, and I decided to step away to figure out what I truly wanted. Around the same year, an opportunity to work on a big Italian cruise ship appeared — it kind of knocked on my door at the perfect time. At that moment there was nothing to lose, so I decided to take it. This unexpected experience helped me understand that changing your career path doesn’t necessarily mean failure but might help you discover who you really are and where you belong.
Working on an international cruise ship sounded like a crazy adventure, and in many ways it was. I still can’t believe my parents let me go to an unknown place when I was only twenty years old. On the day of my arrival in Savona, Italy — it’s fun how I still remember this place without thinking too much — I remember a bus picking up many employees from different countries including me heading toward the cruise ship. The first time I saw the ship I was amazed how huge, bright, and beautiful it was, and I told to myself  “This is going to be my home for the next few months”. I met amazing people from all over the world, learned new foreign languages, and visited beautiful popular cities I had never imagined I could be in. However, life on board was not easy at all. We worked long hours with no days off, and rest was really a privilege. The schedule was very tight, and you had to sacrifice your rest if you wanted to explore the city — which I did many times and don’t regret.
One long dark night of service on the second floor of the restaurant, an important general cleaning was happening. I was really exhausted but still doing my best. When my supervisor checked my station and said my drawer was still dirty, I cleaned it again — and again, when she asked one more time. It was almost midnight, and I felt frustrated and thought the supervisor was being unfair to me. My arms and legs were sore, my back hurt, and all I wanted was to finish my long duty and sleep. At that moment, while wiping the same grey drawer again, I asked myself if this was really what I wanted to do with life. It was small but powerful moment that made me question everything. I realized that the problem wasn’t studying or working hard, it was finding something that truly fits me. I wanted to learn, grow, and build something meaningful, but I couldn't do that there.
When my nine months contract ended, I decided not to return. I went back to my country and started looking for affordable universities offering Software Engineering programs. I still wanted to travel, so I looked for scholarships and international exchange opportunities. When I finally got enrolled and later gain a scholarship to study in Spain for a semester, I knew I made the right decision. Classes were great and I made great friends that are still in my life now.  It was the first time I felt completely engaged in what I was learning and building. It was not an easy path either, but I knew I belonged there and accepted the challenge.
Changing my career path was one of the hardest decisions I’ve ever made, but also one of the best. I learned that changing direction should not be considered as a failure, or something you did wrong and trying to fix, it means growth. Sometimes, you have to let go of what doesn’t fit and move forward. Choosing a new path helped me find my real passion, and it showed me that everything happens for a reason and leads you to the right place in the end.
