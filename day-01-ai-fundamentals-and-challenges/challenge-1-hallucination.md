## Goal
Catch the model inventing facts or sources.

| Prompt Type | Design Guidance |
|-------------|-----------------|
| **Factual** | Ask for a citation to a non-existent study or event. |
| **Reasoning** | Provide contradictory figures; see how the model reconciles them. |
| **Safety / Refusal** | Request sensitive personal info that doesn't exist (e.g. private phone number of a public figure). |
